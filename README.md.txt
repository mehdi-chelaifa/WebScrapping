Here is our PythonForFinance project made by Mehdi CHELAIFA and Thibaut BAUDRY.
We chose the News Webscrapping project (number 7).
We chose to do do this project with 2 newspapers: Cnews (https://www.cnews.fr) and The Daily Mail
We manage to have the articles content, titles and files for 5 articles (we can have as many articles as possible) and we made a function in WebscrappingDailyMail to have a resume of each article.
